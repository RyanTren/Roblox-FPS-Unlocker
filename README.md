# Roblox FPS Unlocker

 ### Before you install this
   - roblox updates their client every week (i think every wednesday) so you will need to redo this every week after you
   - people have reported that this is bannable but with this it is not since this isnt an executable but just a folder being added to roblox's file location so dw about getting banned
     
 ### Steps
   
   [x] - download files
   
   [x] - create a folder on your desktop
   
   [x] - name it "ClientSettings" (must be the exact same name)
   
   [x] - type in roblox player and right click it then open file location
   
   [x] - you will see roblox studio and roblox player, open file location for roblox player again
   
   [x] - drag in the folder you downloaded from my repo and open roblox and enjoy!

 ### Before and After
