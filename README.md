# Roblox FPS Unlocker

 ### Before you install this
   - roblox updates their client every week (i think every wednesday) so you will need to redo this every week after you 
   - people have reported that this is bannable but with this it is not since this isnt an executable but just a folder being added to roblox's file location so dw about getting banned

### Features to be Added

  - may possibly make a exe that does the steps below so it isn't as tedious...
     
 ### Steps
   
   [x] - download "ClientSettings" folder from this repo
   
   [x] - type in roblox player and right click it then open file location
   
   [x] - you will see roblox studio and roblox player, open file location for roblox player again
   
   [x] - drag in the folder you downloaded from my repo and open roblox and enjoy!

 ### Before and After

  - WIP
